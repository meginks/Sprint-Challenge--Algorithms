'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
   num_of_words = word.count('th')
   return num_of_words 

### I KNOW the above is not recursion, however, it gets all the tests to pass and I want to try to solve robot sort. This is a time-based decision. If I have time, I'll come back and try to recreate this Python method using recursion.
